zeFresk's dotfiles

### Introduction
Here you will find my configuration for vim and tmux along with my .bashrc
Almost everything comes from others and I only made my own mix.
Compatible with WSL.

### Installation
Just git clone the repository and run install.

```
git clone https://github.com/zeFresk/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
chmod +x install
./install
```

You will have to change the default terminal font manually if you choose to install powerline.
